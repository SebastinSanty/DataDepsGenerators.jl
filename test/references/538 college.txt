	This repo contains the data and code for FiveThirtyEight's story on earnings of college majors.
	All data is from American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series.
	
	Download data here: http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html
	
	Documentation here: http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/pums.html
	
	college-majors-rscript.R:
	- My R script for parsing the data. 
	- Assumes you've already downloaded the data and selected only records with non-NA values for college major (FOD1P)
	- Outputs data to csv
	
	majors-list.csv:
	- List of majors with their FOD1P codes and major categories.
	- Major categories are from Carnevale et al, \"What's It Worth?: The Economic Value of College Majors.\" Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, 2011. http://cew.georgetown.edu/whatsitworth
	
	Three main data files:
	- all-ages.csv
	- recent-grads.csv (ages <28)
	- grad-students.csv (ages 25+)
	All contain basic earnings and labor force information. 
	recent-grads contains more detailed breakdown, including by sex and by the type of job they got. Full headers below.
	grad-students contains details on graduate school attendees.
	
	Additionally, women-stem.csv contains data for scatter plot in associated DataLab post on women in science/technology jobs. It is a subset of recent-grads.csv. (Small easter egg: Check out my related Shiny app: https://bencasselman.shinyapps.io/new-test/)
