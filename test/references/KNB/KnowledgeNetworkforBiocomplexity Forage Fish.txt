	We evaluate the total forage fish biomass available for aquaculture feed (i.e., supply) from the FAO total reported catches. We classify species in the database as 'forage fish' by excluding inland (freshwater) areas, selecting from only ISSCAAP 'marine fishes,' and extracting the respective maximum sizes from Fishbase. We set a cutoff of 1200g maximum weight (corresponding to a max length of approximatrely 50 cm) for fish included in the analysis. For species that were reported on the genus level, we use average maximum weight. Supplementary Table S1 includes the 20 highest catching forage fish in 2012 (last year of FAO forage fish fee estimates), comprising 71% of the total forage fish catch. In total we calculated the average catch (after 1980) of forage fish to be approximately 31 million tonnes per year, comprising about 38% of the global catch. We estimate the future potential availability of forage fish for aquaculture by calculating the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of each stock in the FAO database, using the data-poor method, catch-MSY. We describe the method in brief detail below. For simplicity, we define a stock as a unique species in a unique FAO area. Although each FAO area potentially contains multiple biological stocks of each species, we assume the sum of MSY from each stock equals the total MSY in an area. Stocks with total cumulative catches less than 100 tonnes are excluded for data quality reasons. The catch-MSY method assumes that a fish population can be described by the Schaefer equation (see paper for specific equation). Forage fish are generally productive speices, so we first run all simulations with a prior uniform distribution of  relatively high growth rates, r ~(0.5,1.2) and carrying capacityies of K ~(max(C), 100 max(C)). After first 30,000 runs we screen the r-K pairs that provide successful fits (viable r-K pair) and rerun the model again with distributions covering the minimum and maximum possible r-K values from that set. All successful r-K combinations are used to calculated MSY for each species. The resulting simulationd yield MSY estiamtes from 401 stocks (238 speices), encompassing a total of >99% of the forage fish catches in 2012. To calculate the 'true supply' of forage fish for feed we reduce all MSY values by 10% to account for the portion of forage fish typically used for direct human consumption. Forage fish often exhibit fluctuations in abundance, hence the MSY values calculated here are not expected to be constant in time, but rather a long term average potential catch. As forage fish dynamics often are driven by changes in recruitment, we emphasize that the MSY value within a stock is associated with large confidence intervals. Baseline scenario: We simulate animal protein production and associated forage fish requirements for pig, poultry, and fed aquaculture taxa for 196 countries (226 regions - countries and territories). First, we calculate baseline ('current') forage fish use for each animal selected, in each country. Animal production is calculated from FAO biomass values. Current proportions of fed aquaculture species on feed (266 speices, 67 nei, ISSCAAP groups, excluding filter-feeding silver, bighead, catla, rohu, and mrigal carp) are used to parameterize and test the baseline model. All fed aquatic species (except the miscellaneous freshwater fishes group, which is held at 60%) are assumed to be on feed by 2050, based on trends reported in the literature. The miscellaneous freshwater species are held at reduced proportions to account for the unspecified group of freshwater unfed fishes reported in the literature. All feed conversion ratios and diet proportions of fishmeal and oil for each animal group are randomly sampled from a uniform range of respective taxonomic values (supplementary Table S2). No diet proportions are available for pig and poultry. As a result, values are calculated to reflect the reported total usage of fishmeal and oil by the respective agricultural animal group and are thus held constant. Future scenarios: We then calculate future (2050) animal production (all poultry, pigs, and fed aquaculture) based on human consumption trends. Trends derived from the Tilman and Clark  2015 paper. For business-as-usual, we account for the majority of production growth expected to occur within developing nations by adding or substracting a 10% to the projected percent production increase for developing and developed countries, respectively, based on FAO reports. Under all future scenarios, animal production growth occurs where it already exists proportional to current levels and wild catches are assumed constant. Business-as-usual animal production increases by 52% in 2050 and fed aquaculture expected a ca.2-fold increase. Under the 2050 pescetarian scenario, assume a three-fold increase in aquaculture production from the current level across developed and developing nations.  Overall, the purpose of the study is to explore a handful of feasible levers of change given existing seafood trends that assume fed aquaculture is increasing and the majority will continue to be freshwater fish species. We run six future scenarios of how forage fish are managed and used for feed assuming rising cultivation follows exponential growth. Each modeled scenario is run 500 times to account for variation in feed conversion ratios and diet proportion data. Present to 2050.
